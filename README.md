# slovenia
A prototype for a travel journey through Slovenia with Leaflet Maps

## Reason

I wanted to plan a cycle trip through Slovenia and find out:

* Where are cool places?
* Which routes can I include?
* Which routes can I cut by train?

## External tools

I use google sheets to store the places to go to. I also want to put a photo
and a little description there. Traveling by tables is how I would like
to procede in the future

## Used plugins

* [Leaflet GPX](https://github.com/mpetazzoni/leaflet-gpx)
* [Leaflet Awesome markers](https://github.com/lvoogdt/Leaflet.awesome-markers)
* [Pretty Checkbox](https://github.com/lokesh-coder/pretty-checkbox)
